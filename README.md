# faster_taxi_tip_prediction

###### Source code is provided as preview doesnot responding

so these is a regression based snap ml project on faster taxi tip and from the final output we can clearly say that 
The snap ml has an advatage of been fast as it provided faster result with the same accuracy as of scikit learn the MSE score of both the 
system are neraly same but snap ml give a score of 1.655 and the scikit model gives the MSE score of 1.636 which neraly same but snap ml is much faster compare to scikit learn

### The data used in the lab : https://jupyterlab-6-labs-prod-jupyterlab-us-east-0.labs.cognitiveclass.ai/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/labs/authoride/IBMSkillsNetwork%2BML0101EN/labs/Module%203/yellow_tripdata_2019-06.csv

In this exercise session you will consolidate your machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using a popular regression model: Decision Tree. You will use a real dataset to train such a model. The dataset includes information about taxi tip and was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). You will use the trained model to predict the amount of tip paid.

In the current exercise session, you will practice not only the Scikit-Learn Python interface, but also the Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library. Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but it also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy.
